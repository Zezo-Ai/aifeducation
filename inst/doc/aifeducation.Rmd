# 1) Installation and Technical Requirements
## Introduction
Several packages allow users to use machine learning directly in *R*
such as [nnet](https://cran.r-project.org/package=nnet) for single layer
neural nets, [rpart](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rpart) for
decision trees, and [ranger](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ranger)
for random forests. Furthermore, with
[mlr3verse](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mlr3verse) a series of
packages exists for managing different algorithms with a unified
interface.

These packages can be used with a 'normal' computer and provide an easy
installation. In terms of natural language processing, these approaches
are currently limited. State-of-the-art approaches rely on neural nets
with multiple layers and consist of a huge number of parameters making
them computationally demanding. With specialized libraries such as keras
and tensorflow, graphical processing units (gpu) can help to speed up
computations significantly. However, many of these specialized libraries
for machine learning are written in python. Fortunately, an interface to
python is provided via the *R* package
[reticulate](https://cran.r-project.org/package=reticulate).

The R package *Artificial Intelligence for Education (aifeducation)*
aims to provide educators, educational researchers, and social
researchers a convincing interface to these state-of-the-art models for
natural language processing and tries to address the special needs and
challenges of the educational and social sciences. The package currently
supports the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for tasks such
as text embedding, classification, and question answering.

Since state-of-the-art approaches in natural language processing rely on
large models compared to classical statistical methods (e.g., latent
class analysis, structural equation modeling) and are based largely on
python, some additional installation steps are necessary.

If you would like to train and to develop your own models and AIs, a
compatible graphic device is necessary. Even a low performing graphic
device can speed up computations significantly. If you prefer using
pre-trained models however, this is **not** necessary. In this case a
'normal' office computer without a graphic device should be sufficient
in most cases.

## Step 1 - Install the R Package

In order to use the package, you first need to install it. This can be
done by:

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("FBerding/aifeducation",
                         dependencies = TRUE)
```

With this command, all necessary *R* packages are installed on your
machine. 

## Step 2 - Install Python

Since natural language processing with neural nets is based on
models which are computationally intensive, *keras* and *tensorflow* are
used within this package together with some other specialized python
libraries. To install them, you need to install python on your machine
first. This may take some time.

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
reticulate::install_python()
```

You can check if everything is working by using the function
`reticulate::py_available()`. This should return `TRUE`.

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
reticulate::py_available(initialize = TRUE)
```

## Step 3 - Install Miniconda

The next step is to install miniconda since *aifeducation* uses conda 
environments for managing the different modules.
```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
reticulate::install_miniconda()
```

## Step 4 - Install Support for Graphic Devices

If you would like to use a graphic card for computations you need to install
some further software. A list with links to downloads can be found here:
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#linux

In general you need

- NVIDIA GPU Drivers
- CUDA Toolkit
- cuDNN SDK

## Step 5 - Install Specialized Python Libraries

If everything is working, you can now install the remaining python
libraries. For convenience, *aifeducation* comes with an auxiliary
function `install_py_modules()` doing that for you.

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install_py_modules(envname="aifeducation")
```

This function installs the following python modules:

-   transformers,
-   tokenizers,
-   datasets,
-   torch,
-   keras,
-   tensorflow 
-   codecarbon

and its dependencies in the environment "aifeducation". 
    
If you would like to use *aifeducation* with other packages or within
other environments, please ensure that these python modules are
available.

With `check_aif_py_modules()` you can check, if all modules are
successfully installed.

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
aifeducation::check_aif_py_modules(print=TRUE)
```

Now everything is ready to use the package. 

**When you start a new *R*
session, please note that you have to call
`reticulate::use_condaenv(condaenv = "aifeducation")` 
to make the python modules available for work.**

# 2) Configuration

In general, educators and educational researchers neither have access to
high performance computing nor do they own computers with a performing
graphic device for their work. Thus, some additional configuration can
be done to get computations working on your machine.

If you do use a computer that does not own a graphic device, you can
disable the graphic device support of tensorflow with the function
`set_config_cpu_only()`.

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
aifeducation::set_config_cpu_only()
```

Now your machine only uses cpus for computations.

If your machine has a graphic card with limited memory, it is
recommended to change the configuration of the memory usage with
`set_config_gpu_low_memory()`

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
aifeducation::set_config_gpu_low_memory()
```

This enables your machine to compute 'large' models with limited
resources. For 'small' models, this option is not relevant since it
decreases the computational speed.

Finally, in some cases you might want to disable tensorflow to print
information on the console. You can change the behavior with the
function `set_config_tf_logger()`. 
```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
aifeducation::set_config_tf_logger()
```
You can choose between five levels
"FATAL", "ERROR", "WARN", "INFO", and "DEBUG", setting the minimal level
for logging.
