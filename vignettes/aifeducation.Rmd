# 1) Installation and Technical Requirements

## Introduction

Several packages allow users to use machine learning directly in *R*
such as [nnet](https://cran.r-project.org/package=nnet) for single layer
neural nets, [rpart](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rpart) for
decision trees, and [ranger](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ranger)
for random forests. Furthermore, with
[mlr3verse](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mlr3verse) a series of
packages exists for managing different algorithms with a unified
interface.

These packages can be used with a 'normal' computer and provide an easy
installation. In terms of natural language processing, these approaches
are currently limited. State-of-the-art approaches rely on neural nets
with multiple layers and consist of a huge number of parameters making
them computationally demanding. With specialized libraries such as
*keras*, *PyTorch* and *tensorflow*, graphical processing units (gpu)
can help to speed up computations significantly. However, many of these
specialized libraries for machine learning are written in python.
Fortunately, an interface to python is provided via the *R* package
[reticulate](https://cran.r-project.org/package=reticulate).

The R package *Artificial Intelligence for Education (aifeducation)*
aims to provide educators, educational researchers, and social
researchers with a convincing interface to these state-of-the-art models
for natural language processing and tries to address the special needs
and challenges of the educational and social sciences. The package
currently supports the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for
tasks such as text embedding and classification.

Since state-of-the-art approaches in natural language processing rely on
large models compared to classical statistical methods (e.g., latent
class analysis, structural equation modeling) and are based largely on
python, some additional installation steps are necessary.

If you would like to train and to develop your own models and AIs, a
compatible graphic device is necessary. Even a low performing graphic
device can speed up computations significantly. If you prefer to use
pre-trained models however, this is **not** necessary. In this case, a
'normal' office computer without a graphic device should be sufficient
in most cases. To get ready for using the package, two steps are
necessary.

## Step 1 - Install the R package

First you need to install the package. This can be done by:

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("aifeducation")
```

With this command, `aifeducation` is installed on your machine.

## Step 2 - Install Python and optional R packages

Since natural language processing with neural nets is based on models
which are computationally intensive, *PyTorch* is used within this
package together with some other specialized python libraries.

The most straightforward method for getting started is to call the
function `install_aifeducation` as follows:

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install_aifeducation(
  install_aifeducation_studio = TRUE
)
```

This function will install python, miniconda, and all relevant python
libraries into a conda environment called "aifeducation".

In addition, we recommend to set `install_aifeducation_studio=TRUE`
since this will install the optional *R* packages necessary to use *AI
for Education - Studio*. *AI for Education - Studio* is a graphical user
interface for applying these packages. We recommend to use it for
everyone who is unfamiliar with *R* or machine learning. If you do not
want use the studio, you can set the argument to `FALSE`. In this case
you have to use the package with *R* syntax.

If you have a suitable machine and would like to use a graphic card for
computations you need to install some further software. You can find
further information here: <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>

You can check if python is working by using the function
`reticulate::py_available()`. This should return `TRUE`.

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
reticulate::py_available(initialize = TRUE)
```

You can check if all necessary python packages are successfully
installed by calling the function `check_aif_py_modules`

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
aifeducation::check_aif_py_modules()
```

Now everything is ready to use the package.

# 2) Starting a new session

The most convenient way to work with the package is to use *AI for
Education - Studio* which you can start by calling
`aifeducation::start_aifeducation_studio()`.

In case you do not want to use the graphical user interface, you have to
prepare your *R* sessions. First, it is necessary that you set up python
via 'reticulate' and choose the conda environment where all necessary
python libraries are available. Then you can load `aifeducation`. In
case you installed python as suggested in this vignette, you may start a
new session like this:

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
reticulate::use_condaenv(condaenv = "aifeducation")
library(aifeducation)
```

> **Note:** Please remember: Every time you start a new session in *R,*
> you have to to set the correct conda environment and load the library
> `aifeducation`. This is not necessary if you use *AI for Education -
> Studio*.

# 3) Tutorials and Guides

A guide on how to use the graphical user interface can be found in
vignette [02 Using the graphical user interface Aifeducation -
Studio](https://fberding.github.io/aifeducation/articles/gui_aife_studio.html).

A short introduction into the package with examples for classification
tasks can be found in vignette [03 Using R
syntax](https://fberding.github.io/aifeducation/articles/classification_tasks.html).

Documenting and sharing your work is described in vignette [04 Sharing
and using trained AI/models](https://fberding.github.io/aifeducation/articles/sharing_and_publishing.html).

# 4) Update *aifeducation*

In case you already use *aifeducation* and you want to update to a newer
version of this package, it is recommended to update the used python
libraries as well. The easiest way is to remove the conda environment
"aifeducation" and to install the libraries into a fresh environment.
This can be done by setting `remove_first=TRUE` in `install_py_modules`.

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
aifeducation::install_py_modules(
  remove_first = TRUE
)
```
